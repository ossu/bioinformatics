## About

This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a [Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

To become a bioinformatician, you have to learn quite a lot of science, so be ready for subjects like; Biology, Chemistry, etc...

## Motivation & Preparation

Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", which consists of learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.

- [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)

The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.

## How to use this guide

### Order of the classes

This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start the first course, [Introduction to Biology](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-biology-secret-life-mitx-7-00x-2), when you done with it, start the next one.

**If the course is not open, do it with the archived resources or wait until next class is open.**

### How to track and show your progress

1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/yax8Kgnh) board to your personal account. See how to copy a board [here](http://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally/).

Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.

We also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process. The meaning of each of these labels is:

- `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
- `Extra Courses`: cards with that label represent courses that was added by the student.
- `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing.
- `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.
- `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum. Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column. You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.
- `Extra Sections`: cards with that label represent sections that was added by the student.

The intention of this board is to provide for our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the status of your board to be **public** or **private**.



### Should I take all courses?

**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here! Also we highly encourage you to complete more by reading papers and attending research projects after your coursework is done.

### Duration of the course

It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular Bioinformatics course, but we can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

> See more about "Commit to a process, not a goal" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

### Project Based

Here in **OSS University**, you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!

In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project** or write **papers and publish them** about your focus with Bioinformatics.

> "What does it mean?"

After finish a course, you should think about a **real world problem** that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.

  Put the OSSU-Bioinformatics badge in the README of your repository! [![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)

  - Markdown: `[![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics ](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)`
  - HTML: `<a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics"><img alt="Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg"></a>`

**You can create this project alone or with other students!**

### Be creative!

This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.

You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate **and this is what really matters**!

In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!

Here are some tips about how you can do that:

- **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.
- **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.

### Cooperative work

**We love cooperative work**! Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

### Which programming languages should I use?

List of skills:
- C/C++
- Unix System
- Python/Perl
- R
- Algorithms

These skills mentioned above are the very essential tool set that bioinformatician and computational biologist depends on.

The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Content Policy

You must share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

[Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:

### Stay tuned

[Watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) this repository for futures improvements and general information.

## Prerequisite

Students without a strong high school background in Biology will benefit from [Getting up to Speed in Biology](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+Pre-7.01+1T2020/about).

Understanding how to use Git to version your work can be hugely beneficial and is generally not taught in other courses. [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) should get you up to speed.

## How to collaborate

You can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions as to how we can improve this guide, or what we can do to improve the learning experience.

You can also [fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to fix any mistakes that you have found.

TODO:
If you want to suggest a new resource, send a pull request adding such resource to the [extras](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics/tree/master/extras) section.

The **extras** section is a place where all of us will be able to submit interesting additional articles, books, courses and specializations, keeping our curriculum *as immutable and concise as possible*.

**Let's do it together! =)**
