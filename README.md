## About

This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a **Bioinformatics** course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

To become a bioinformatician, you have to learn quiet a lot of science, so be ready for subjects like; Biology, Chemistry, etc...

## Becoming an OSS student

To officially register for this course you must create a profile in our [web app](https://ossu.firebaseapp.com).

**ps**: Currently, the web app is for tracking the progress of the [Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) path, but we are working to extend this functionality for all of our courses. Thanks for the comprehension.

> **"How can I do this?"**

Just create an account on GitHub and log in with this account in our web app.

The intention of this app is to offer for our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc.

In the "My Progress" tab, you are able to edit the status of the courses that you are taking, and also add the link of your final project for each one.

## Motivation & Preparation

Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", which consists of learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.

- [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)

The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.

## How to use this guide

### Order of the classes

This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start the first course, [Introduction to Biology](), when you done with it, start the next one.

**If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.**

### Should I take all courses?

**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here! Also we highly encourage you to complete more by reading papers and attending research projects after your coursework is done.

### Duration of the course

It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular Bioinformatics course, but we can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

> See more about "Commit to a process, not a goal" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

### Project Based

Here in **OSS University**, you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!

In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project** or write **papers and publish them** about your focus with Bioinformatics.

> "What does it mean?"

After finish a course, you should think about a **real world problem** that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.

> This part needs upgrade:
  - The projects of all students will be listed in [this](https://github.com/open-source-society/help/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) file. Submit your project's information in that file after you conclude it.
  - Research focused projects

  Put the OSSU-Bioinformatics badge in the README of your repository! [![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)

  - Markdown: `[![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics ](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)`
  - HTML: `<a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics"><img alt="Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg"></a>`

**You can create this project alone or with other students!**

And you should also...

### Be creative!

This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.

You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate **and this is what really matters**!

In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!

Here are some tips about how you can do that:

- **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.
- **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.

### Cooperative work

**We love cooperative work**! Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

### Which programming languages should I use?

List of skills:
- C/C++
- Unix System
- Python/Perl
- R
- Algorithms

These skills mentioned above are the very essential tool set that bioinformatician and computational biologist depends on.

The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### Content Policy

You must share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

[Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:

## Change Log


## How to collaborate

You can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and give us your suggestions as to how we can improve this guide, or what we can do to improve the learning experience.

You can also [fork this project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to fix any mistakes that you have found.

TODO:
If you want to suggest a new resource, send a pull request adding such resource to the [extras](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics/tree/master/extras) section.

The **extras** section is a place where all of us will be able to submit interesting additional articles, books, courses and specializations, keeping our curriculum *as immutable and concise as possible*.

**Let's do it together! =)**
